Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over structured knowledge from the Harry Potter universe. The pipeline supports scalable document ingestion, semantic embedding using SentenceTransformers, FAISS-based vector retrieval, and local response generation via the GPT4All language model to enable accurate, real-time question answering over fictional lore.
